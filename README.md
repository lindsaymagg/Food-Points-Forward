# Food-Points-Forward

HackDuke 2018
Team members: Lu, Christine, Stephanie, Nathan, Jeremy

• Created an application in a team of five students using Java meant to address food insecurity and inequality on Duke’s campus
• Allows students to: check their food point balance and assess whether they are underspending or overspending with regard to Duke’s recommended spending plan, request additional food points from other Duke students by posting to a public list sorted based on student financial need, and donate any number of possessed food points to other students with financial need
